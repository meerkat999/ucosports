#UCOSPORST - MICRO-SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

###INTRODUCTION:

The architecture of micro-services is proposed for the boom it is generating in the technological and development environment.

###BENEFITS:

* The microservices are small.
* They are independent of each other.
* High scalability. Each developer could work in a microservice without disturbing the work of another developer.
* Failures / errors only affect the microservice that generated it, not the entire project.
